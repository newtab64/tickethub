# TicketHub CI/CD Restructuring and End-to-End Orchestration Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Complete the full CI/CD transformation across all remaining phases: landing Stages 0 and 1 locally onto `unstable`, implementing Stage 2 with native Playwright orchestration and parallel CI caching, implementing Stage 3 with production Dockerfile and governance hardening, and verifying final linear landing.

**Architecture:** Staged sequential execution that strictly separates PR-safe application code from protected workflow infrastructure files (`.github/**`). Playwright orchestrates backend and frontend server lifecycles natively via `webServer` without shell backgrounding, and `ci.yml` is split into parallel caching jobs with unified error aggregation.

**Tech Stack:** GitHub Actions, Playwright v1.49+, Fastify NestJS, Next.js 16, pnpm v12, Docker multi-stage build, TypeScript.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-02-ci-pipeline-restructure-and-e2e-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Zero emojis in any commit message, PR body, or documentation.
- Zero en-dash or em-dash characters in any output or file.
- Strictly no remote push operations (`git push` forbidden).
- Strict separation between PR branches and DIRECT commits based on the `PROTECTED_INFRASTRUCTURE_PATTERNS` regex in `scripts/pr-gate-check.mjs`.
- All checks must pass with zero warnings (`--max-warnings 0`, strict TypeScript).

## Review Focus

- Failure mode 1: Port conflict or hanging process during Playwright `webServer` launch in local dev when an existing API or Web instance is running (`reuseExistingServer: true` required).
- Failure mode 2: E2E test runner failure due to unseeded database in fresh CI virtual machine (isolated `e2e` job must run `pnpm db:migrate` and `pnpm db:seed` against its service container).
- Failure mode 3: Missing system shared libraries on Playwright browser cache hit (`playwright install-deps chromium` must execute even when cache hits).
- Failure mode 4: PR Gate rejection if `.github/workflows/**` edits are committed to a PR branch (must strictly quarantine to DIRECT branches).
- Failure mode 5: Container build failure or memory exhaustion if devDependencies or entire workspace is bundled into production image (`pnpm --filter @tickethub/api deploy --prod` required).

- [ ] **Step 3: Rewrite Dockerfile with multi-stage build**
      Implement 4-stage build:

1. `base`: Alpine Node 22 + pnpm.
2. `dependencies`: Copy manifests and install frozen dependencies.
3. `builder`: Compile `@tickethub/shared` and `apps/api`, then prune with `pnpm --filter @tickethub/api deploy --prod /app/pruned`.
4. `runner`: Minimal Alpine, copy from `/app/pruned`, non-root user `USER node`, and `HEALTHCHECK` with Node.js native fetch.
